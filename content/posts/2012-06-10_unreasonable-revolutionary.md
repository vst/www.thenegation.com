*[How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method]* by [George Pólya]
provides a detailed and entertaining survey of general methods for problem
solving, namely *heuristics*. I guess that most people dealing with mathematics
in daily life have read this book.

Recently, I came across *[How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics]*. This book, like
its *predecessor*, is about problem solving, but it focuses on computational
methodologies for problem solving. There are many beautiful comments on the book
around the Internet.

I was especially delighted when I read the introductory chapter. Below is a
quote from [George Bernard Shaw], which is given at the beginning of the very
first chapter:

> The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists
> in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the
> unreasonable man.
>
> -- George Bernard Shaw, Maxims for Revolutionists.

George Bernard Shaw is an interesting man. I like his humour: He is provocative,
yet gentle. When I read his views on Islam and the transcript of the meeting of
him with Maulana Abdul Aleem Siddiqui, I was sad that I had not been introduced
to his writings earlier.
